<h1 align="center">Diabetes</h1>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin produced by the pancreas lowers blood glucose. Absence or insufficient production of insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes.
The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 and type 2. Former names for these conditions were insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile onset and adult onset diabetes.
Symptoms of  type 1 and type 2 diabetes include:
<ul>
<li>excessive thirst</li>
<li>weight loss</li>
<li>hunger</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>skin problems</li>
<li>increased urine output</li>
<li>slow healing wounds</li>
<li>yeast infections</li>
<li>Tingling or numbness in the feet or toes.</li>
</ul>
Some of the risk factors for getting diabetes include being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and low levels of the "good" cholesterol (HDL) and elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood.
If you think you may have pre-diabetes or diabetes contact a health-care professional.
<h2>What is diabetes?</h2>
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels that result from defects in insulin secretion, or its action, or both. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was first identified as a disease associated with "sweet urine," and excessive muscle loss in the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia) lead to spillage of glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine.
Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level by promoting the uptake of glucose into body cells. In patients with diabetes, the absence of insufficient production of or lack of response to insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime.
<h2>9 early signs and symptoms of diabetes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The early symptoms of untreated diabetes are related to elevated blood sugar levels, and loss of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output (frequent urination) and lead to dehydration.</li>
<li>The dehydration also causes increased thirst and water consumption.</li>
<li>A relative or absolute insulin deficiency eventually leads to weight loss.</li>
<li>The weight loss of diabetes occurs despite an increase in appetite.</li>
<li>Some untreated diabetes patients also complain of fatigue.</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting can also occur in patients with untreated diabetes.</li>
<li>Frequent infections (such as infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas) are more likely to occur in people with untreated or poorly-controlled diabetes.</li>
<li>Fluctuations in blood glucose levels can lead to blurred vision.</li>
<li>Extremely elevated glucose levels can lead to lethargy and coma.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I know if I have diabetes?</h2>
Many people are unaware that they have diabetes, especially in its early stages when symptoms may not be present.
There is no definite way to know if you have diabetes without undergoing blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels (see section on Diagnosis of diabetes).
See your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes or if you are concerned about your diabetes risk
<h2>What causes diabetes?</h2>
Insufficient production of insulin (either absolutely or relative to the body's needs), production of defective insulin (which is uncommon), or the inability of cells to use insulin properly and efficiently leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes.
This latter condition affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues, and results in a condition known as insulin resistance. This is the primary problem in type 2 diabetes.
The absolute lack of insulin, usually secondary to a destructive process affecting the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, is the main disorder in type 1 diabetes.
In type 2 diabetes, there also is a steady decline of beta cells that adds to the process of elevated blood sugars. Essentially, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can, to some degree, increase production of insulin and overcome the level of resistance. After time, if production decreases and insulin cannot be released as vigorously, hyperglycemia develops.
<h2>What are the risk factors for diabetes?</h2>
Risk factors for type 1 diabetes are not as well understood as those for type 2 diabetes. Family history is a known risk factor for type 1 diabetes. Other risk factors can include having certain infections or diseases of the pancreas.
Risk factors for type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes are many. The following can raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes:
<ul>
<li>Being obese or overweight</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of "good" cholesterol (HDL)</li>
<li>Sedentary lifestyle</li>
<li>Family history</li>
<li>Increasing age</li>
<li>Polycystic ovary syndrome</li>
<li>Impaired glucose tolerance</li>
<li>Insulin resistance</li>
<li>Gestational diabetes during a pregnancy</li>
<li>Ethnic background: Hispanic/Latino Americans, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Alaska natives are at greater risk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the different types of diabetes?</h2>
There are two major types of diabetes, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes was also formerly called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself, and is rendered incapable of making insulin. Abnormal antibodies have been found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1 diabetes must rely on insulin medication for survival.

<h3>Type1</h3>
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.
Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults.
Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.
<ul>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
Type 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can appear relatively suddenly and may include:
<ul>
<li>Increased thirst</li>
<li>Frequent urination</li>
<li>Bed-wetting in children who previously didn't wet the bed during the night</li>
<li>Extreme hunger</li>
<li>Unintended weight loss</li>
<li>Irritability and other mood changes</li>
<li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes</h3>
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing (islet, or islets of Langerhans) cells in the pancreas. Other possible causes include:
<ul>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors</li>
</ul>
<h3>The role of insulin</h3>
Once a significant number of islet cells are destroyed, you'll produce little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).
<ul>
<li>The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.</li>
<li>Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter your cells.</li>
<li>Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.</li>
<li>As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The role of glucose</h3>
Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.
<ul>
<li>Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.</li>
<li>Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.</li>
<li>Your liver stores glucose as glycogen.</li>
<li>When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose levels within a normal range.</li><br>
</ul>
In type 1 diabetes, there's no insulin to let glucose into the cells, so sugar builds up in your bloodstream. This can cause life-threatening complications.
<h3>Risk factors</h3>Some known risk factors for type 1 diabetes include:
<ul>
<h4>Family history:</h4>Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition.
<h4>Genetics:</h4> The presence of certain genes indicates an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes.
<h4>Geography:</h4>The incidence of type 1 diabetes tends to increase as you travel away from the equator.
<h4>Age</h4>Although type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, it appears at two noticeable peaks. The first peak occurs in children between 4 and 7 years old, and the second is in children between 10 and 14 years old.
</ul>
<h3>Complications</h3>
Over time, type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs in your body, including heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Maintaining a normal blood sugar level can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications.

Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening.
<ul>
<h4>Heart and blood vessel disease:</h4> Diabetes dramatically increases your risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.
Nerve damage (neuropathy). Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to eventually lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs.
Damage to the nerves that affect the gastrointestinal tract can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue.
<h4>Kidney damage (nephropathy):</h4>The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.
<h4>Eye damage:</h4> Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially causing blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.
<h4>Foot damage</h4> Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections that may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.
<h4>Skin and mouth conditions:</h4> Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to infections of the skin and mouth, including bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely.
<h4>Pregnancy complications</h4>High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled. For the mother, diabetes increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic eye problems (retinopathy), pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and preeclampsia.
</ul>
<h3>Prevention</h3>
There's no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. But researchers are working on preventing the disease or further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed.
</ul>
<h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3> Diabetes is a life-long disease that affects the way your body handles glucose, a kind of sugar, in your blood.
Most people with the condition have type 2. There are about 27 million people. with it. Another 86 million have prediabetes: Their blood glucose is not normal, but not high enough to be diabetes yet.
<ul>
<h4>Symptoms:</h4>
Type 2 diabetes can cause serious health complications. That's why it is very important to know how to spot type 2 diabetes symptoms. Even prediabetes can increase the chance of heart disease, just like type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Talk to your doctor about preventive measures you can take now to reduce the chance of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
The symptoms of type 2 diabetes due to high blood sugar may include:
<ul>
<li>Increased thirst</li>
<li>Increased hunger (especially after eating)</li>
<li>Dry mouth</li>
<li>Frequent urination</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry)</li>
<li>Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)</li>
<li>Blurred vision</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Loss of consciousness (rare)</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Causes Diabetes?</h4>
Your pancreas makes a hormone called insulin. It's what lets your cells turn glucose from the food you eat into energy. People with type 2 diabetes make insulin, but their cells don't use it as well as they should. Doctors call this insulin resistance.
At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to try to get glucose into the cells. But eventually it can't keep up, and the sugar builds up in your blood instead.
Usually a combination of things cause type 2 diabetes, including:
<ul>
<h4>Genes:</h4> Scientists have found different bits of DNA that affect how your body makes insulin.
<h4>Extra weight:</h4> Being overweight or obese can cause insulin resistance, especially if you carry your extra pounds around the middle. Now type 2 diabetes affects kids and teens as well as adults, mainly because of childhood obesity.
<h4>Metabolic syndrome:</h4>People with insulin resistance often have a group of conditions including high blood glucose, extra fat around the waist, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and triglycerides.
<h4>Too much glucose from your liver:</h4>When your blood sugar is low, your liver makes and sends out glucose. After you eat, your blood sugar goes up, and usually the liver will slow down and store its glucose for later. But some people's livers don't. They keep cranking out sugar.
<h4>Bad communication between cells:</h4>Sometimes cells send the wrong signals or don't pick up messages correctly. When these problems affect how your cells make and use insulin or glucose, a chain reaction can lead to diabetes.
<h4>Broken beta cells:</h4>If the cells that make the insulin send out the wrong amount of insulin at the wrong time, your blood sugar gets thrown off. High blood glucose can damage these cells, too.
