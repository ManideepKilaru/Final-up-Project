# AGILE THERAPEUTIC SYSTEMIZATION
  Agile Therapeutic Systemization is aimed to design an interface which connects patients and doctors together in a single platform. Through this website one can access and gain understanding on remedial of diseases. In proposed system, the prime objective is to create a full-fledged web application which could give clear information of diseases and the price of medicines.
