<h2>Common Skin Disorders</h2>
Skin disorders vary greatly in symptoms and severity. They can be temporary or permament, and may be painless or painful. Some have situational causes, while others may be genetic. Some skin conditions are minor, and others can be life-threatening.
While most skin disorders are minor, others can indicate a more serious issue. Contact your doctor if you think you might have one of these common skin problems.
<ul>
<h3>Inflammatory bowel disease:</h3>
Inflammatory bowel disease is a term for a group of intestinal disorders that cause prolonged inflammation of the digestive tract. These bowel-related disorders often cause skin problems.
The drugs used to treat these diseases can cause certain skin conditions, such as:
<ul>
<li>skin tags</li>
<li>anal fissures</li>
<li>stomatitis</li>
<li>vasculitis</li>
<li>vitiligo</li>
<li>allergic eczema</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diabetes</h3>
Many people with diabetes experience a skin problem as a result of their condition at some point. Some of these skin disorders only affect people with diabetes. Others occur more frequently in people with diabetes because the disease increases the risk for infection and blood circulation problems. 
Diabetes-related skin conditions include:
<ul>
<li>bacterial infections, such as boils, styes, and folliculitis</li>
<li>fungal infections, such as athlete’s foot, ringworm, and yeast infections</li>
<li>acanthosis nigricans</li>
<li.diabetic blisters</li>
<li>diabetic dermopathy</li>
<li>digital sclerosis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Warts</h3>
Warts are raised bumps on your skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Warts have plagued humans for thousands of years — they have been discovered on 3,000-year-old mummies and were mentioned by Shakespeare. Although warts generally aren’t dangerous, they are ugly, potentially embarrassing, and contagious. They can also be painful.There are more than 100 types of HPV, the virus that causes warts. Almost all types of HPV cause relatively harmless warts that appear on your hands or feet.
<h3>Contact dermatitis:</h3>
Contact dermatitis is one of the most common occupational illnesses. The condition is often the result of contact with chemicals or other irritating materials. These substances can trigger a reaction that causes the skin to become itchy, red, and inflamed. Most cases of contact dermatitis aren’t severe, but they can be rather itchy. Topical creams and avoiding the irritant are typical treatments.
<h3>Keratosis pilaris:</h3>
Keratosis pilaris is a minor condition that causes small, rough bumps on the skin. These bumps usually form on the upper arms, thighs, or cheeks. They’re typically red or white and don’t hurt or itch. Treatment isn’t necessary, but medicated creams can improve skin appearance
Some chronic skin conditions are present from birth, while others appear suddenly later in life.The cause of these disorders isn’t always known. Many permanent skin disorders have effective treatments that enable extended periods of remission. However, they’re incurable and symptoms can reappear at any time. 
</ul>
<h2>Examples of chronic skin conditions include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>rosacea, which is characterized by small, red, pus-filled bumps on the face</li>
<li>psoriasis, which causes scaly, itchy, and dry patches</li>
<li>vitiligo, which results in large, irregular patches of skin</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skin disorders in children</h2>
Skin disorders are common in children. Children can experience many of the same skin conditions as adults. Infants and toddlers are also at risk for diaper-related skin problems. Since children have more frequent exposure to other children and germs, they may also develop skin disorders that rarely occur in adults. Many childhood skin problems disappear with age, but children can also inherit permanent skin disorders. In most cases, doctors can treat childhood skin disorders with topical creams, medicated lotions, or condition-specific drugs.
<h2>Symptoms of skin disorders</h2>
Skin conditions have a wide range of symptoms. Symptoms on your skin that appear due to common problems aren’t always the result of a skin disorder. Such symptoms can include blisters from new shoes or chafing from tight pants. However, skin problems that have no obvious cause may indicate the presence of an actual skin condition that requires treatment.
Skin irregularities that are typically symptoms of a skin disorder include:
<ul>
<li>raised bumps that are red or white</li>
<li.a rash, which might be painful or itchy</li>
<li>scaly or rough skin</li>
<li>peeling skin</li>
<li>ulcers</li>
<li>open sores or lesions</li.
<li>dry, cracked skin</li>
<li>discolored patches of skin</li>
<li>fleshy bumps, warts, or other skin growths</li>
<li>changes in mole color or size</li>
<li>a loss of skin pigment</li>
<li>excessive flushing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Causes of skin disorders</h2>
Common known causes of skin disorders include:
<ul>
<li>bacteria trapped in skin pores and hair follicles</li>
<li>fungus, parasites, or microorganisms living on the skin</li>
<li>viruses</li>
<li>a weakened immune system</li>
<li>contact with allergens, irritants, or another person’s infected skin</li>
<li>genetic factors</li>
<li>illnesses affecting the thyroid, immune system, kidneys, and other body systems</li>
</ul>
Numerous health conditions and lifestyle factors can also lead to the development of certain skin disorders. Some skin conditions have no known cause.
