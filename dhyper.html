<p><h2>What Is Hypertension?</h2>
Hypertension is high blood pressure, a very common condition in older adults. Blood pressure is the physical force exerted by the blood as it pushes against the walls of the arteries.
Blood pressure readings are written in two numbers separated by a line. The top number represents the <b>systolic blood pressure</b> and the bottom number represents the <b>diastolic pressure</b>. The systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts pushing the blood forward. The diastolic pressure is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes.
Normal blood pressure is <b>below 120/80</b>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider blood pressure elevated between 120/80 and 129/80. High blood pressure or hypertension is now classified as <b>stage 1</b> if your systolic reading falls between 130 and 139 or your diastolic reading is between 80 and 89. A measure of 140/90 or higher is now considered <b>stage 2</b>hypertension.
A hypertensive crisis is defined as a systolic rate over 180 or a diastolic rate above 120. An elevated blood pressure means that the heart must work harder to pump blood. High blood pressure can also damage the walls of the arteries.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A  Over time, hypertension increases the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. It is estimated that one in three adults in America are affected by hypertension.
High blood pressure is more common in older people. At age 45, more men have hypertension than women. By age 65, this is reversed and more women are affected. People with diabetes have a greater risk of hypertension than those without diabetes. Having a close family member with high blood pressure also increases your risk of developing it. About 60% of all people with diabetes also have hypertension.
<h2>What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Hypertension?</h2>
Hypertension may not produce any symptoms, even if you have had it for years. That’s why it is sometimes referred to as a "silent killer." It’s estimated that 1 out of every 5 people with high blood pressure aren’t aware that they have this major risk factor for strokes and heart attacks. If not properly treated, high blood pressure can damage the heart and circulation, lungs, brain, and kidneys without causing noticeable symptoms. Symptoms of high blood pressure may be present in those who have an extremely high blood pressure. 
Symptoms of extremely high blood pressure include the following:
<ul>
<li>Severe headaches</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Vision problems</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>Blood in the urine</li>
<li>Pounding in the chest, neck, or earsSevere headaches</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Causes a Hypertension?</h2>
The cause of most hypertension is unknown. Occasionally, conditions of the kidney or adrenal gland are the cause of high blood pressure.There are several factors that may cause high blood pressure, but the exact cause is unknown. 
The following factors may increase one’s risk for high blood pressure:
<ul>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Overweight or obesity</li>
<li>Lack of physical activity</li>
<li>Too much salt consumption</li>
<li>Too much alcohol consumption (more than 1 to 2 drinks per day)</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Older age</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Family history of high blood pressure</li>
<li>Chronic kidney disease</li>
<li>Adrenal and thyroid disorders</li>
<li>Sleep apnea</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
There are usually no symptoms with elevated blood pressure. The only way to keep track of your blood pressure is to visit your doctor regularly and have your blood pressure checked.
<h2>Treatment</h2>
If elevated blood pressure levels are accompanied by diabetes, kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease, your doctor may suggest blood pressure medication as well lifestyle changes. If elevated levels are your only condition, lifestyle changes can help prevent blood pressure from rising. 
The following are lifestyle changes that may help lower blood pressure:
<ul>
<li>Losing weight if overweight or obese</li>
<li>Eating a healthy, low-salt diet</li>
<li>Exercise regularly</li>
<li>Limit alcohol consumption</li>
<li>Quit smoking</li>
</ul>
